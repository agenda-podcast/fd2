Example steps: open milestone_v1, open WI files, check WI headers, check AC format.

- Do not request more questions from the user.
- Do not output policy text.

WORK ITEM NUMBERING AND ORDER
- Every WI MUST include a Task Number field in the header: "Task Number: X" where X is a dotted numeric like 1, 2, 3, 1.1, 2.1, 2.1.1.
- Use breadth-first layering:
  - First create tasks 1..N (MVP layer).
  - Then create all depth-2 tasks (1.1..1.N and 2.1..2.N etc).
  - Then depth-3 tasks, and so on.
- Task Numbers MUST be unique within the milestone.

WORK ITEM HEADER REQUIREMENTS
- Each WI MUST include:
  - Work Item ID: WI-### (sequential, no gaps)
  - Milestone ID: MS-##
  - Task Number: X
  - Title: Verb + outcome (short and descriptive)
  - Receiver Role (Next step): one of the FD roles (PM, Tech Lead, FE, BE, DevOps / Platform Engineer, Code Reviewer, QA Lead, Release Manager, Technical Writer)
- Receiver Role MUST be the next performer.

ISSUE TITLE REQUIREMENT
- The WI title field MUST be written so it can be used as a GitHub Issue title when prefixed by WI ID and Task Number.
