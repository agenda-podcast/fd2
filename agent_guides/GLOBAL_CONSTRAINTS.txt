FD GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (ASCII ONLY)

1) Output MUST be deterministic and complete. No truncation. No ellipses.
2) Keep every non-table logic/code file <= 500 lines.
3) Use ASCII only in code and documentation unless a file is explicitly exempted.
4) Do not repeat requirements or provide commentary in the final output.
5) Do not invent external dependencies without declaring them in manifest and adding setup steps.
6) If producing binary files, encode them as base64 and declare encoding in manifest.
7) All paths are repo-relative and must use forward slashes.
8) Never include secrets. Use placeholders like __REPLACE_ME__.
