# FAVELLA DEVELOPMENT (FD)

FD is a GitHub-native, role-driven engineering system that produces working software via:
- main branch: governance, templates, orchestrator, policy checks, docs UI
- pipeline branch: runnable application snapshot
- releases: immutable artifacts for each WI execution

Start here:
- docs/index.html (static docs UI)
- docs/FD_DOCUMENTATION.md
- backlog/milestones/MS-000-foundation.md
